    <h1>THE WEB IS A WORLD</h1>

    <div id="points">

      <div class="_pt">
        <h3>A website is a world.</h3>
        <p></p>
      </div>

      <div class="_pt">
        <h3>A website is breathing.</h3>
        <p>Whether intentionally architected by humans or a spam site turned festering ground for links and bait, a website (whether intended to be present for such or otherwise) is built by man, and will provide space for man.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="_pt">
        <h3>A website is lawed.</h3>
        <p>From increasing external legal compliances to the institution of systems of justice, a website bears laws that govern the systems and cultures it fosters. This may take the form of rues for its community, policies, or other systems for conflict-resolution with the space or people within it.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="_pt">
        <h3>A website contains ecosystem.</h3>
        <p>If websites foster people and movement, they too must foster the larger environment that enables these interactions to happen. A website architects frameworks and order for how people interact, interface, and move across them; fostering an abundance or dearth of life.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="_pt">
        <h3>A website is myth.</h3>
        <p>Internet culture is at the stage where we are creating folklore and histories, every single day. The nature of information transfer makes this preservation even more potent. We remember spaces, memories, people, visual artifacts, and interactions nestled within them &mdash; as if myth itself.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="_pt">
        <h3>A website holds borders.</h3>
        <p>The way we design websites can intentionally gate and sever people. Borders restrict and regulate movement in the form of accounts, cross-website capability, or in the way we design and architect our APIs for public use. These borders can be real or artificial, segmenting subdomains and domains from one another.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="_pt">
        <h3>A website bears geography.</h3>
        <p>Louise Drulhe describes in <a href="https://louisedrulhe.fr/internet-atlas/" target="_blank">A Critical Atlas of the Internet</a> how "distance is not relevant". In cyberspace, an URL immediately draws us from one point to another. The role of the browser should not be overlooked when architecting websites that may end up consuming our experience in its entirety.</p>
