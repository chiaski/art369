In Project 1: Tour, I explored a recollection of the Bisita Iglesia in <em>Bisita</em>, a Catholic ritual in the Philippines.<br><br>

In Project 2: Extension, I created a series of extensions working around the concept of <em>Proximities</em>.<br><br>

In Project 3: Clock, I worked on <em>Apocalypse</em>, an experimetal 'decremental' multiplayer game that subverts the idle/broken mouse genre.
